## Migrating from TSLint

For mapping TSLint rule overrides in your own project to the equivalent ESLint rules please refer to the [map](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin/ROADMAP.md). If you cannot find the rule simply Google it as ESLint is plugin based and there is likely a plugin offering the required functionality.
